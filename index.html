    1. --a;
    - a is decremented by 1, so a becomes 1 (2-1=1)
    <br>
2. --a - --b;
    - a is decremented by 1 (already done in step 1), so a is still 1
    - b is decremented by 1, so b becomes 0 (1-1=0)
    - The expression becomes 1 - 0 = 1
    <br>

3. --a - --b + ++b;
    - a is decremented by 1 (already done in step 1), so a is still 1
    - b is decremented by 1 (already done in step 2), so b is still 0
    - b is incremented by 1, so b becomes 1 (0+1=1)
    - The expression becomes 1 - 0 + 1 = 2
    <br>

4. --a - --b + ++b + b--;
    - a is decremented by 1 (already done in step 1), so a is still 1
    - b is decremented by 1 (already done in step 2), so b is still 1
    - b is incremented by 1 (already done in step 3), so b is still 1
    - b is decremented by 1, so b becomes 0 (1-1=0)
    - The expression becomes 1 - 0 + 1 + 0 = 2
    - However, the final value of b is 0, not 1, due to the post-decrement operation
    So, the final values are a = 1, b = 0, and result = 1. Note that the result is 1, not 2, due to the post-decrement operation on b.
